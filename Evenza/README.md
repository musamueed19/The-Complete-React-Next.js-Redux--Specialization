# Evenza - Your go-to for events that matter.
### "Plan better. Attend smarter."
#
#### This project actually contains two projects:
- A React.js application (i.e., the frontend SPA)
- A dummy backend API to which the React app can "talk" (to send + fetch data)

You must run `"npm install"` in both project folders.

Thereafter, you can start the dummy backend API server via `"npm start"` (inside the server folder)
The React app dev server is then also started via `"npm start"` (though inside the client folder)

**You MUST have both servers (backend + frontend) up and running for the projects "Evenza".**

The dummy backend API does not use any external database - instead the dummy data.
